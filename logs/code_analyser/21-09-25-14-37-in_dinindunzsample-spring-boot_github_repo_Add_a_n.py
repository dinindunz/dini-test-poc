I'll help you add a new 'PREPARING' status to the order workflow in the dinindunz/sample-spring-boot repository. Let me start by setting up the repository and analysing the codebase to identify the relevant files.

Now let me search for order-related code to understand the current status workflow:
Tool #9: search_code

Tool #10: search_code
Perfect! I found the Order entity with the status enum. Let me analyse this file to understand the current order workflow:
Tool #11: analyse_file
Now let me read the Order.java file to see the current status enum and understand the workflow:
Tool #12: file_read
Perfect! I can see the current OrderStatus enum on line 185. Now let me search for any other files that might reference these order statuses to ensure I update all relevant places:
Tool #13: search_code
Let me also search for any specific references to CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, or SHIPPED to see if there are any business logic dependencies:
Tool #14: search_code
Let me check if there are any service classes that might have business logic related to order status transitions:
Tool #15: find_files
Let me search for any OrderService or order-related business logic:
Tool #16: search_code
Let me check if there are any controllers that might handle order operations:
Tool #17: find_files

Tool #18: search_code
Now let me create a feature branch and make the necessary changes. Based on my analysis, I need to:

1. Add 'PREPARING' status to the OrderStatus enum between 'CONFIRMED' and 'SHIPPED'
2. The change appears to be isolated to the Order.java file since no other business logic specifically references the individual status values
Tool #19: shell
Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-preparing-status'
Now I'll modify the Order.java file to add the PREPARING status between CONFIRMED and SHIPPED:
Tool #20: editor
Now let me add a helper method to mark an order as preparing, similar to the existing markAsShipped and markAsDelivered methods:
Tool #21: editor
Let me verify the changes by viewing the modified file:
Tool #22: editor
Perfect! Now let me check the git status and commit the changes:
Tool #23: shell

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested feature to add a new 'PREPARING' status between 'CONFIRMED' and 'SHIPPED' in the order workflow. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated OrderStatus Enum**: Modified the `OrderStatus` enum in `src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/entity/Order.java` to include the new `PREPARING` status between `CONFIRMED` and `SHIPPED`.

2. **Added Helper Method**: Implemented a `markAsPreparing()` method similar to the existing `markAsShipped()` and `markAsDelivered()` methods for easy status transition.

### Order Workflow:
The updated order status flow is now:
- **PENDING** → **CONFIRMED** → **PREPARING** → **PROCESSING** → **SHIPPED** → **DELIVERED** → **CANCELLED** → **RETURNED**

### Technical Details:
- **File Modified**: `src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/entity/Order.java`
- **Branch Created**: `feature/add-preparing-status`
- **Commit Message**: Used conventional commit format with detailed description
- **Backward Compatibility**: The changes maintain full backward compatibility

### Repository Status:
- ✅ Feature branch created and pushed to remote repository
- ✅ Changes committed with descriptive commit message
- ✅ Ready for pull request creation

### Pull Request:
The pull request can be created manually at: 
**https://github.com/dinindunz/sample-spring-boot/pull/new/feature/add-preparing-status**

The implementation is minimal, focused, and maintains the existing codebase structure while adding the requested functionality. The new `PREPARING` status provides better granularity in order lifecycle management, allowing businesses to track when orders are being prepared for processing as a distinct phase from actual processing.📊 Metrics logged to: logs/21-09-25-14-37-in_dinindunzsample-spring-boot_github_repo_Add_a_n.json (without traces content)
