I'll help you add a new 'PREPARING' status to the order workflow. Let me follow the process step by step.

1. First, let's clone the repository and create a feature branch:
Tool #1: shell
Cloning into 'sample-spring-boot'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 43, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (43/43), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (30/30), done.
remote: Total 43 (delta 5), reused 43 (delta 5), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (43/43), 20.57 KiB | 540.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-preparing-status'
Now, let's find where the order status is defined:
Tool #2: shell
./sample-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/repository/OrderRepository.java
./sample-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/util/OrderNumberGenerator.java
./sample-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/entity/Order.java
./sample-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/ecommerce/entity/OrderItem.java
Let's check the Order entity file to find the status enum:
Tool #3: file_read
Now let's look for any service classes that might handle order status transitions:
Tool #4: shell
We need to add the new 'PREPARING' status between 'CONFIRMED' and 'SHIPPED'. Let's modify the Order.java file:
Tool #5: editor
Now let's commit our changes and create a PR:
Tool #6: shell
[feature/context-aware-agent b8158da] feat: add PREPARING order status between CONFIRMED and SHIPPED
